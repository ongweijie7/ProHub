Key utilities include a To-Do List, Calendar, Focus Timer, and a monthly Progression Chart for self-assessment.

## Motivation
As victims of procrastination, us as students have come to realize how time consuming procrastination can be. Having often set ambitious goals for the day only for it to be disrupted by our lack of motivation and drive which ultimately leads us to chasing piling up deadlines and struggling with our academic workload. Therefore, we wanted to create a centralized studying application that provides extrinsic motivation for students to stay motivated and accomplish their goals and tasks.
